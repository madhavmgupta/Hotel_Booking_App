# Hotel_Booking_App
By Madhav Gupta,

**Hotel Booking App**

Developed a comprehensive hotel booking application leveraging the power of the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. The frontend of the application was designed using React, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface. Node.js and Express.js were used to build a robust backend, ensuring seamless interaction between the frontend and the MongoDB database. This architecture enabled efficient data handling and storage, offering users a smooth and reliable experience while browsing and booking hotels.

To enhance the application's performance and user experience, React Query was integrated for efficient data fetching and state management. This library simplified the management of server-state in the application, allowing for more predictable and maintainable code. Additionally, Tailwind CSS was employed to style the application, providing a modern, responsive, and visually appealing user interface. Tailwind CSS's utility-first approach enabled rapid development and consistent design across the application.

For payment processing, Stripe was integrated to ensure secure and seamless transactions. Stripe's robust API and extensive documentation facilitated the implementation of payment features, including handling payments, refunds, and payment confirmations. Moreover, Cloudinary was utilized for image storage and management, enabling efficient handling of hotel images. This integration allowed for real-time image transformations and optimizations, ensuring high-quality visuals without compromising performance. Overall, this project demonstrates a strong command of full-stack development, state management, modern styling, and third-party integrations.
